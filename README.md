# Author Intrusion (Node.js)

[Author Intrusion](https://authorintrusion.com/) is a set of tools and libraries used to create an IDE-like environment for writers. It is focused less on user-friendly UIs and more toward static configuration files, such as typically found in programming frameworks (such as `package.json` for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) packages).

This package, `node-author-intrusion-echo`, is a plugin to detect and identify echo words within the content. It is dependent on [node-author-intrusion-split](https://github.com/author-intrusion/node-author-intrusion-split) to be called first.

For the core Author Intrusion functionality, see [node-author-intrusion-service](https://github.com/author-intrusion/node-author-intrusion-service) and [node-author-intrusion-cli](https://github.com/author-intrusion/node-author-intrusion-cli).
